# Move mode
Move mode dictates the mode of which to move the player, currently the available modes are: 
- `hold`: Leaving the direction key pressed until direction change to keep the player constantly moving.
- `teleport`: Constantly teleports the player, make sure to set all teleportation keys (i.e. if `up+shift` teleport you up than set this as your `teleport_up` key). this would also overwrite `hold_up` to `false`.

# Smart direction
When smart direction is enabled the player will be constantly guided into the center of the map, this feature will overwrite `change_direction_period` to 0.
